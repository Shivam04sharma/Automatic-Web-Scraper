# Automatic-Web-Scraper
The Automatic Web Scraper is a Python tool that fetches and parses HTML pages from multiple domains using asyncio and aiohttp for concurrent network I/O. It features a Tkinter GUI, supports seed URLs, real-time output, and unique domain tracking. Two versions allow fast dummy testing or live web crawling.
